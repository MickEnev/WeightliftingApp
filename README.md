# McTracker
App designed to track your lifts across different sessions with the ability to see previous workouts and PR's.

## Usage
Run a local instance of MySQL and input your credentials into the app.py. Run app.py and visit localhost to see the app in action. From there you can start a workout and it will save to your local MySQL database.

## Roadmap
I plan on changing the database to Firebase to allow for better storage and remove the need for MySQL.
